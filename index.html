      <h2>Parks</h2>
      <p>
        There are several parks and green spots in Stavanger municipality, both
        in the city and beyond. Central to the town is the city lake which is in
        turn surrounded by the city park, built as the city's first urban park
        in 1866–1868. Between the city park and the bay is located Kielland
        garden, which got its name because the poet Alexander Kielland's house
        at the time was here. Kielland Park went through a major renovation in
        2007 as part of the Millennium in Stavanger municipality.

      <h2>Outdoor activities</h2>
      <p>
        There are not many outdoor activities in Stavanger itself, however,
        splendid opportunities are nearby in adjacent municipalities:
        Lysefjorden is particularly popular for hiking.[71] Tourists typically
        visit places like Preikestolen (aka the Pulpit Rock), and Kjeragbolten.
        Preikestolen is a massive rock overhanging the fjord (604 metres below).
        Kjeragbolten is a rock wedged in the cliff approximately 1,000 metres
        above the fjord. The straight fall 1,000 metres down to the fjord makes
        Kjerag a very popular location for BASE jumping. Not too far from
        Stavanger, alpine centers are available for skiers and snowboarders
        throughout the winter season.

      <h2>Sea</h2>

        Located outside Stavanger, there is a port serving ferries to Hirtshals,
        Denmark. There have been advocates for the Smyril Line ferry between the
        Faroe Islands and Denmark to make a stop in Stavanger as the new port in
        Risavika allows this to be done while only adding one hour to the total
        sailing time. Local ferries go to Tau and Kvitsøy, while fast passenger
        boats go to many villages and islands between the main routes from
        Stavanger to Haugesund and Sauda. There are plans to re-establish the
        ferry link to Newcastle in the United Kingdom, which was suspended in
        2008.
